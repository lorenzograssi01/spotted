*Spotted* is a social network platform that makes it easy to connect with people around you.

Users can create posts, either public or anonymous, within communities such as schools, cities, or hobbies. Others can interact by liking, commenting, or applying to posts. The "apply" feature lets users directly connect, and once accepted, they can continue the conversation through private messages.

Itâ€™s a simple way to find company for events, meet new people, and build communities around shared interests.

The script database.sql initializes the database and puts some data in it for illustrative purposes, and the credentials for the demo users can be found in the passwords.txt file.
